HONOS is an open source political simulator game where you play the role of an imaginary country's president.

You will have to manage resources, apply policies, establish international relationships and so on. The goal is to make your citizens as happy as you can.

****************ATTENTION****************

The graphic engine (ahem, ahem) is is based on DirectX, in fact, you need DXUT[1] to compile it (and lots of luck because there's no makefile at this time ^_^).

The game engine (ahem, ahem, ahem) is written in standard C++ (no windows or .NET libraries) so I suppose it will be possible to run the game on any OS provided you could install wine[2].

I made this "thing" for my degree project in college and it's veeeeery crappy.
